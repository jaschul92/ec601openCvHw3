Exercise 1

The cvMat object containts the size of the matrix as well as the address to matrix that contains the values of the pixels. The size of the matrix is always constant. For a grayscale object there is a single channel/value at the index of the matrix. In the case of RGB, there are 3 channels for the value of the pixel.

Exercise 3

As the values increased the images got increasibly noiser. In addition, when you increased the kernel size the images got more blurred. The guassin filters helps to reduce noise when gaussian noise is applised to the image. The median filters helps to reduce noice when salt and pepper noise is added to an image.
